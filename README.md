# Deep Learning algorithms with TensorFlow

This repository is a collection of various Deep Learning algorithms implemented using the
[TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org) library. This package is intended as a command line utility you can use to quickly train and
evaluate popular Deep Learning models and maybe use them as benchmark/baseline in comparison to your custom models/datasets.

### Requirements:

* tensorflow >= 0.6 (tested on tensorflow 0.6, 0.7.1 and 0.8)

### Documentation:

You can find the documentation for this project at this [link](http://deep-learning-tensorflow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
